# Minimal Analog Clock

There came a time when I needed an analog clock to time a few things. I tried searching the internet, but I couldn't find one that was minimal, distraction-free, and visually pleasing. With all the AI code generation tools available, I decided to try coding one myself. The generation took about a minute, but actually fixing the analog clock components, like the dials and numbers, took me a few hours of manual work to get it just right.
