# Minimal Analog Clock

There came a time when I needed an analog clock to time a few things. I tried searching the internet, but I couldn't find one that was minimal, distraction-free, and visually pleasing. With all the AI code generation tools available, I decided to try vibe coding one myself. The generation took up to a minute, but actually fixing of the analog clock parts, like the dials or numbers, took me a few hours of manual work to get it just right.
